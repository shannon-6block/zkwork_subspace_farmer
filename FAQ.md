### Q1: Why is the mining pool dashboard not displaying mining data after plotting has been completed?

A: After the mainnet launch, a period of time was reserved for miners to plot disks. The block reward will be enabled later. Please wait for further notifications.

### Q2: Are there Windows and HiveOS versions?

A: Currently, Windows and HiveOS are not supported.

### Q3: Is CPU plotting supported?

A: Both CPU and GPU can be used for plotting, but GPU is recommended because of efficiency.

### Q4: How can I check the plotting progress?
A: You can check the logs of the farmer or plotter. After starting plotting, the logs will display information similar to the following:
```
Plotting sector（XX% complete）
```

### Q5: Is it possible to use multiple GPUs for plotting?
A: Multiple GPUs are supported, and the software will use all available GPUs by default.

### Q6: Is the software compatible with the official version? Is it compatible with other mining pools?
A: They are not compatible. Like other storage mining projects, the sectors generated by the mining pool's plotting software are permanently bound to the mining pool.

### Q7: What should be noted when starting the software?
A: When starting, make sure to add the `--pot-external-entropy 00000000000000000000d695f8a14ff24a8dfb68245cec4a4b6787de86e232fe` parameter to specify the PoT seed for the mainnet.
